<h1>INACCESSIBLE_BOOT_DEVICE,<br> when SATA to NVME</h1><br>

Windows automatically removes unused storage drivers from the early-boot process.<br><br>

So, if cloning a SATA system drive then only the SATA driver (e.g. StorAhci) was likely enabled for "boot start", 
while the NVMe driver is deferred to a later phase. This is why it's visible in diskmgmt.msc when booted into system.<br><br>

Fix is to run this command before cloning:<br>
<blockquote>C:\> sc config stornvme start= boot</blockquote><br>

Now clone the system and BSOD should be gone in Windows 10/11/2019+.<br>
(Granted that you have taken care of UEFI/Legacy and have a healthy system partition).<br><br>

Alternatively, you can change stornvme to Start=0 / StartOverride=0 in registry. 
Mount %windir%\system32\config\SYSTEM and find it under ControlSet001(when remotely mounted) and services.
